  
# About:
  This is a open-source bot, fell free to see it, use it, fork it, or update it (any help and/or    improvement will be appreciated).
  First thing first, this project was developed for my personal use to get a night's sleep ðŸ˜´ðŸ¥± without having to wake up at dawn to start the fights on Luna Rush. So, I decided to publish it here to help people who like me have 3 warriors or less (may have future upgrades to work with more characters).

  If this project saves you a few hours of sleep too, consider paying  me an energy drink ðŸ¥¤ðŸ˜€âš¡ to gimme the power to keep working on that.

# How to use?

Open the terminal, cd into the folder if you haven't yet:

```
"cd" + path
```

To run it use the command

```
python index.py
```
Assim que ele iniciar ele vai comeÃ§ar tentando iniciar uma luta. Para que ele funcione Ã© preciso que a janela do game esteja aparecendo na sua tela, e suas guerreiras jÃ¡ selecionadas nos 3 slots.
Ele vai constantemente checar se vocÃª foi desconectado para realizar o login novamente.

As soon as you start the bot it will try to start a boss hunt. For it to work the game window needs to be visible, and your warriors already selected on the 3 slots for fight.
It will constantly check if it needs to login again.
